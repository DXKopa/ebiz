<p>Converge Incorperation was founded in 2015 by Darren Kopa, Daniel Lin and Forest Yang with the sole purpose of building a banquet hall service with the integration of an e-commerce website. Today, the company's fundamental goals and ideals have remained unchanged, continuing its mission to provide its patrons with services of the utmost quality.</p>

<p>We offer unprecedented services to our customers, including an irresistable assortment of hors d'oeuvre and drinks, a 50-foot ballroom and world-class attendents ready to address your needs and wants. Our most distinuishing feature to date, however, is our widely acclaimed website, which gives customers a chance to reserve their event in advance without the hassle of picking up the phone or filling out convoluted paperwork. Converge wanted to give its customers a quick and easy process for creating reservations, so its founders built a powerful, no-frills website to complete just that.</p>
